## 🛡️ Privacy, Reimagined
I care about the app's growth, but I care about your privacy even more. This app is designed with a **Transparency-First** policy:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **I have ZERO interest in your browsing habits.**
> - 🚫 **No URL Tracking:** I don't (and physically can't) see which websites you visit, what you search, or what you type.
> - 🕵️ **Self-Hosted Analytics:** I use a private **Umami** instance. No IP track, No Google, No Meta, no Big Tech trackers.
> - 🆔 **Anonymous Data:** I only see **"The app was opened"** and **This App Versions**. I use a random, anonymous UUID that isn't tied to your device ID or personal info.

## 📱 Quick Start & Safety 🚦

#### 🛑 Developer's Safety Request

* **Driver's Duty:** If you're the one steering, **DO NOT LOOK AT THIS APP.** If you think your eyes might wander while driving, **uninstall it right now!** Seriously, your safety is my top priority.
* **Passenger's Joy:** This app is for your passengers or for when you are safely parked.
* **Legal Note:** I built the code, but the **GPLv3 license** means I am **NOT RESPONSIBLE** for your actions. Drive smart!
